# AP_Project

Rosalien Kinds & Jamie Leigh Stoer

The project 
------------
This program will match subtitles to the script of a movie, but will not only do just that. 
It also adds the timestamps, line numbers, labels of each line, character name and will show you the percentage of 
matching lines between the subtitles and script. 

Who did  what 
--------------
We started off with three people in our group, but Rosalie decided to quit the studies. 
This was a few weeks after we started the project, so everyone already started an we could not fuse with another group.
So this project is done by Rosalien and Jamie.  

Rosalien was responsible for preprocessing, adding the timestamps, line numbers, matching the script to the subtitles and the
percentage function.
Jamie was responsible for the user interface, adding the labels to the lines, the README file and the unit tests. 

Because we were just with the two of us, we helped eachother regulary. This also led to Rosalien doing more of the programming,
she already started with this before Rosalie stopped and because of the familiarity she had created with the program, 
she took on more of the programming tasks so we could save some time. 

How to use
-----------
To run the program, first download the program from the Github.
Go to the Linux shell and type the following: python3 AP_groepsopdracht.py -scr *your script* -sub *your subtitles* 
After this you can click enter and the program will do its work.
